The assignment involves developing a Python script using the Pygame library to convert a normal image into pointlisme. Users can load an image through a command-line argument, and the script displays the image in a Pygame window. The user can then select a rectangular region by clicking on the image, and the RGB values of the pixels within the selected region are inverted, creating a visual effect. The program runs until the user closes the window or exits the script. 

Run the Script:

	==> python script.py image.png

Select a Region:

	Click on the image to select a rectangular region.
	The RGB values of the pixels within the selected region will be inverted.

Quit the Program:

	Close the window or press Ctrl+C in the terminal to exit the program.
